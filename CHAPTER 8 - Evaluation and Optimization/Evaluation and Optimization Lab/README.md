# Evaluation and Optimization Lab
Notice that this Lab is part B of <a href="https://github.com/ipetel/AWS_Certified_ML-acloud.guru/tree/master/CHAPTER%207%20-%20Algorithms/Algorithms%20Lab">Algorithms Lab</a>

**Use Case**

Mr. K has given us the go to use the Linear Learner model for identifying the legitimacy of a reported UFO sighting. He plans to send out a team of scientist to any reported sighting predicted probable or unexplained. Before deploying the model, he wants us to make sure we have the most optimized model, improve any performance in training, and possibly improve accuracy.

**Goal**

Tune our model to find the most optimized model for our problem.

**My Solution**

I have created an extended solution from the official one, in my solution I have extended explanation for every step<br>
read the notebook for additional explanation.<br>
hope you will find this notebook useful.<br>

**Note**

1. in most of code cell that I'm using external libraries I'm importing it every time, although I can import all of them once on the start of the notebook, I wanted to show what libraries I'm using on every step.
2. there are numerous times that I'm assigning the same variables with the same values on different cells, again just want to to show what variables are used on every step.
