# Modeling Lab

**Use Case**

Mr. K wants to deploy a network of 10 sensors across the globe. He would like to locate these sensors in the center of the most likely locations for UFO sighting.

**Goal**

build a model that will output 10 points (point = pair of {long,lat}) to place the sensors

**My Solution**

I have created an extended solution from the official one, in my solution I have decided to implement an oversampling method to give move weights to some points over others. read the notebook for additional explanation.
hope you will find this notebook useful.
