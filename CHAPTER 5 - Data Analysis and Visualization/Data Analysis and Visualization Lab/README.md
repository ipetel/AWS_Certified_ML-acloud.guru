# Jupyter Notebook Solution to "Data Analysis and Visualization Lab"

This solution was built using AWS SageMaker Notebook but you can run it on local Jupyter Notebook as well.
in this notebook the dataset was uploaded to S3 bucket and than copped to the Notebook folder using AWS Boto3 SDK.

## if you get "Sorry, something went wrong. Reload?" when viewing *.ipynb
Probably a problem with the GitHub notebook viewing tool - sometimes github fails to render the ipynb notebooks

Try to open that notebook that you want using nbviewer online, you don't need to install it.

1) Open "https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/"
2) Paste the link to this notebook: https://github.com/ipetel/AWS_Certified_ML-acloud.guru/blob/master/CHAPTER%205%20-%20Data%20Analysis%20and%20Visualization/Data%20Analysis%20and%20Visualization%20Lab/car%20dealership%20data.ipynb
