# Algorithms Lab

**Use Case**

Mr. K wants to build a model that can predict the legitimacy of a UFO sighting based on information supplied by the submitter. 
We can use the ground truth dataset used in the previous lab. This data has been collected by Mr. K's team who painstakingly determined whether a sighting could be explained (as a hoax or other natural explanation), unexplained, or probable.

**Goal**

build a model to determine whether newly reported UFO sightings are legitimate or not (explained, unexplained, or probable), <br>the model need to be at least 90% accurate

**My Solution**

I have created an extended solution from the official one, in my solution I have extended explanation for evert step starting from Data Collection, Assumptions, Model Selection, EDA, Data Preparation to Train Models and Results.<br>
read the notebook for additional explanation.<br>
hope you will find this notebook useful.<br>

**Note**

1. in most of code cell that I'm using external libraries I'm importing it every time, although I can import all of them once on the start of the notebook, I wanted to show what libraries I'm using on every step.
2. there are numerous times that I'm assigning the same variables with the same values on different cells, again just want to to show what variables are used on every step.
